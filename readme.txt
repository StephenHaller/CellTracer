There are 3 types of figures for each cell type.

AnglePlot_*
>>> Plots all individual cell rotations as an arrow pointing from initial angle (start of tracing) to final angle (end of tracing). Note: the final angle is NOT the angle as determined by the program.

AnglePlot_D_*
>>> Plots a distribution of angle changes from initial angle (start of tracing) to final angle (end of tracing). Note: the final angle is NOT the angle as determined by the program.

AnglePlot_A_*
>>> Plots two distributions of angles: (1) Red initial angle distribution and (2) Blue final angle distribution. Note: the final angle is NOT the angle as determined by the program.
